Help to **unblock science** from **mis-publication** that often occurs in the centralized world. Some **scientific projects** don't receive **funding and publicity**, and if the project is important, that **blocks development** of the entire science.

To **support basic science** I aim to create **grants similar to GitCoin grants** but allocate a portion of each donation to **dependencies and citations**. This will help support underfinanced "invisible" projects and **free software components** that are crucial for building projects that are beneficial to users. Additionally, we will provide an **affiliate program** to ensure that every scientific project is advertised, which will help bring more visibility and funding to important scientific research.

To achieve this vision, I plan to use the revolutionary DFINITY Internet Computer to run Salaries Science grants. This will ensure that every dollar donated goes directly to funding important scientific research and supporting the **underfinanced projects** that often go unnoticed.

Please consider making a donation today to help **unblock science* and **support crucial scientific research** that can change the world for the better. Together, we can ensure that science is never hindered by unfortunate incidents and that every project has the support and funding it needs to succeed.

Personal story behind the project:

In 2019, I discovered ordered semigroup actions that could have been a groundbreaking discovery for world science, but due to a mistake in publication, it was not recognized as such. I became determined to rectify this situation and ensure that such mishaps do not hinder the progress of science in the future.

What's special about _ordered semigroup actions_? It is a discovery that almost all the science depends on, but failed publication hindered progress of science instead of advancing it.
